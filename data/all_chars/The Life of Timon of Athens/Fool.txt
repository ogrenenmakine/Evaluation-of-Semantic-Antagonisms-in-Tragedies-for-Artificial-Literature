How do you, gentlemen?
She's e'en setting on water to scald such chickens
as you are. Would we could see you at Corinth!
Look you, here comes my mistress' page.
Will you leave me there?
Are you three usurers' men?
I think no usurer but has a fool to his servant: my
mistress is one, and I am her fool. When men come
to borrow of your masters, they approach sadly, and
go away merry; but they enter my mistress' house
merrily, and go away sadly: the reason of this?
A fool in good clothes, and something like thee.
'Tis a spirit: sometime't appears like a lord;
sometime like a lawyer; sometime like a philosopher,
with two stones moe than's artificial one: he is
very often like a knight; and, generally, in all
shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore
to thirteen, this spirit walks in.
Nor thou altogether a wise man: as much foolery as
I have, so much wit thou lackest.
I do not always follow lover, elder brother and
woman; sometime the philosopher.
