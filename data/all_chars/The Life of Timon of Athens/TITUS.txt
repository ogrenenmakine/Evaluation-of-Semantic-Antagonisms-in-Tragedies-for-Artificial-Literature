The like to you kind Varro.
So is theirs and ours.
I'll show you how to observe a strange event.
Your lord sends now for money.
And he wears jewels now of Timon's gift,
For which I wait for money.
One of Lord Timon's men.
We attend his lordship; pray, signify so much.
Do you hear, sir?
We wait for certain money here, sir.
O, here's Servilius; now we shall know some answer.
We cannot take this for answer, sir.
My lord, here is my bill.
Mine, fifty talents.
