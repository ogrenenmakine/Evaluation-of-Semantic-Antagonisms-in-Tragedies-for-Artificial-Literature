Nay, that's most fix'd.
And rich: here is a water, look ye.
What, my lord! dispraise?
My lord, 'tis rated
As those which sell would give: but you well know,
Things of like value differing in the owners
Are prized by their masters: believe't, dear lord,
You mend the jewel by the wearing it.
We'll bear, with your lordship.
You know me, Apemantus?
