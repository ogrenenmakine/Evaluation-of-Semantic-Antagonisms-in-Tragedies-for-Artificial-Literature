What time o' day is't, Apemantus?
That time serves still.
Hang thyself!
He's opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in,
And taste Lord Timon's bounty? he outgoes
The very heart of kindness.
The noblest mind he carries
That ever govern'd man.
I'll keep you company.
My lord, we always have confess'd it.
Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that you
would once use our hearts, whereby we might express
some part of our zeals, we should think ourselves
for ever perfect.
You see, my lord, how ample you're beloved.
Where be our men?
I am so far already in your gifts,--
We are so virtuously bound--
The best of happiness,
Honour and fortunes, keep with you, Lord Timon!
The good time of day to you, sir.
Upon that were my thoughts tiring, when we
encountered: I hope it is not so low with him as
he made it seem in the trial of his several friends.
I should think so: he hath sent me an earnest
inviting, which many my near occasions did urge me
to put off; but he hath conjured me beyond them, and
I must needs appear.
I am sick of that grief too, as I understand how all
things go.
A thousand pieces.
What of you?
Ever at the best, hearing well of your lordship.
I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship
that I returned you an empty messenger.
Royal cheer, I warrant you.
How do you? What's the news?
Alcibiades banished!
How! how!
How now, my lords!
He's but a mad lord, and nought but humour sways him.
He gave me a jewel th' other day, and now he has
beat it out of my hat: did you see my jewel?
Let's make no stay.
