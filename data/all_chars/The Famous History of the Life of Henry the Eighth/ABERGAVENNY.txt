I cannot tell
What heaven hath given him,--let some graver eye
Pierce into that; but I can see his pride
Peep through each part of him: whence has he that,
If not from hell? the devil is a niggard,
Or has given all before, and he begins
A new hell in himself.
I do know
Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have
By this so sickened their estates, that never
They shall abound as formerly.
Is it therefore
The ambassador is silenced?
A proper title of a peace; and purchased
At a superfluous rate!
As the duke said,
The will of heaven be done, and the king's pleasure
By me obey'd!
