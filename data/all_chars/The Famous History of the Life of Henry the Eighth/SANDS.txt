New customs,
Though they be never so ridiculous,
Nay, let 'em be unmanly, yet are follow'd.
They have all new legs, and lame ones: one would take it,
That never saw 'em pace before, the spavin
Or springhalt reign'd among 'em.
'Tis time to give 'em physic, their diseases
Are grown so catching.
The devil fiddle 'em! I am glad they are going,
For, sure, there's no converting of 'em: now
An honest country lord, as I am, beaten
A long time out of play, may bring his plainsong
And have an hour of hearing; and, by'r lady,
Held current music too.
No, my lord;
Nor shall not, while I have a stump.
He may, my lord; has wherewithal: in him
Sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine:
Men of his way should be most liberal;
They are set here for examples.
I am your lordship's.
Sir Thomas Lovell, had the cardinal
But half my lay thoughts in him, some of these
Should find a running banquet ere they rested,
I think would better please 'em: by my life,
They are a sweet society of fair ones.
I would I were;
They should find easy penance.
As easy as a down-bed would afford it.
By my faith,
And thank your lordship. By your leave, sweet ladies:
If I chance to talk a little wild, forgive me;
I had it from my father.
O, very mad, exceeding mad, in love too:
But he would bite none; just as I do now,
He would kiss you twenty with a breath.
For my little cure,
Let me alone.
Your grace is noble:
Let me have such a bowl may hold my thanks,
And save me so much talking.
The red wine first must rise
In their fair cheeks, my lord; then we shall have 'em
Talk us to silence.
Yes, if I make my play.
Here's to your ladyship: and pledge it, madam,
For 'tis to such a thing,--
I told your grace they would talk anon.
