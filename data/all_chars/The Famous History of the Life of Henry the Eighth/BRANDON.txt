Your office, sergeant; execute it.
I am sorry
To see you ta'en from liberty, to look on
The business present: 'tis his highness' pleasure
You shall to the Tower.
Nay, he must bear you company. The king
Is pleased you shall to the Tower, till you know
How he determines further.
Here is a warrant from
The king to attach Lord Montacute; and the bodies
Of the duke's confessor, John de la Car,
One Gilbert Peck, his chancellor--
A monk o' the Chartreux.
He.
