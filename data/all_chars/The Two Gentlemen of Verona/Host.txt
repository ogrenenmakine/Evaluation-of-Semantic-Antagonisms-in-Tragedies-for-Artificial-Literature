Now, my young guest, methinks you're allycholly: I
pray you, why is it?
Come, we'll have you merry: I'll bring you where
you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you asked for.
Ay, that you shall.
Hark, hark!
Ay: but, peace! let's hear 'em.
Who is Silvia? what is she,
That all our swains commend her?
Holy, fair and wise is she;
The heaven such grace did lend her,
That she might admired be.
Is she kind as she is fair?
For beauty lives with kindness.
Love doth to her eyes repair,
To help him of his blindness,
And, being help'd, inhabits there.
Then to Silvia let us sing,
That Silvia is excelling;
She excels each mortal thing
Upon the dull earth dwelling:
To her let us garlands bring.
How now! are you sadder than you were before? How
do you, man? the music likes you not.
Why, my pretty youth?
How? out of tune on the strings?
You have a quick ear.
I perceive you delight not in music.
Hark, what fine change is in the music!
You would have them always play but one thing?
I tell you what Launce, his man, told me: he loved
her out of all nick.
Gone to seek his dog; which tomorrow, by his
master's command, he must carry for a present to his lady.
By my halidom, I was fast asleep.
Marry, at my house. Trust me, I think 'tis almost
day.
