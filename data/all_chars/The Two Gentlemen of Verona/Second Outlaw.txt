If there be ten, shrink not, but down with 'em.
Peace! we'll hear him.
Whither travel you?
For what offence?
Have you the tongues?
Tell us this: have you any thing to take to?
And I from Mantua, for a gentleman,
Who, in my mood, I stabb'd unto the heart.
Indeed, because you are a banish'd man,
Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you:
Are you content to be our general?
To make a virtue of necessity
And live, as we do, in this wilderness?
Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd.
Come, bring her away.
