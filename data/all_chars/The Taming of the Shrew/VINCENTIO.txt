Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
That with your strange encounter much amazed me,
My name is call'd Vincentio; my dwelling Pisa;
And bound I am to Padua; there to visit
A son of mine, which long I have not seen.
Lucentio, gentle sir.
But is it true? or else is it your pleasure,
Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest
Upon the company you overtake?
You shall not choose but drink before you go:
I think I shall command your welcome here,
And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward.
Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?
What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, to
make merry withal?
Art thou his father?
Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?
What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see
thy master's father, Vincentio?
Is't so, indeed.
What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortal
gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet! a velvet
hose! a scarlet cloak! and a copatain hat! O, I
am undone! I am undone! while I play the good
husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at
the university.
Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.
His name! as if I knew not his name: I have brought
him up ever since he was three years old, and his
name is Tranio.
Lucentio! O, he hath murdered his master! Lay hold
on him, I charge you, in the duke's name. O, my
son, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio?
Carry me to the gaol!
Thus strangers may be hailed and abused: O
monstrous villain!
Lives my sweet son?
Where is that damned villain Tranio,
That faced and braved me in this matter so?
I'll slit the villain's nose, that would have sent
me to the gaol.
Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to: but
I will in, to be revenged for this villany.
Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you?
'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
