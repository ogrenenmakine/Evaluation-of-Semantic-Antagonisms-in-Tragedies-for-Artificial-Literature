We will rather sleep than talk: we know what
belongs to a watch.
How if they will not?
Well, sir.
If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay
hands on him?
How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?
Well, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit here
upon the church-bench till two, and then all to bed.
This is all.
