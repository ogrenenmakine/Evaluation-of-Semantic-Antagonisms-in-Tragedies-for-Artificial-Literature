Man?
That's hereby.
Lord, how wise you are!
With that face?
So I heard you say.
Fair weather after you!
God give you good morrow, master Parson.
Good master Parson, be so good as read me this
letter: it was given me by Costard, and sent me
from Don Armado: I beseech you, read it.
Ay, sir, from one Monsieur Biron, one of the strange
queen's lords.
Good Costard, go with me. Sir, God save your life!
God bless the king!
I beseech your grace, let this letter be read:
Our parson misdoubts it; 'twas treason, he said.
Of Costard.
