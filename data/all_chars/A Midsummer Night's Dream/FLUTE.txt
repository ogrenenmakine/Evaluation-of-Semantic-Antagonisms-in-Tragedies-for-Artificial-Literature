Here, Peter Quince.
What is Thisby? a wandering knight?
Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard coming.
Must I speak now?
Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,
Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,
Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew,
As true as truest horse that yet would never tire,
I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.
O,--As true as truest horse, that yet would
never tire.
If he come not, then the play is marred: it goes
not forward, doth it?
No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft
man in Athens.
You must say 'paragon:' a paramour is, God bless us,
a thing of naught.
O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a
day during his life; he could not have 'scaped
sixpence a day: an the duke had not given him
sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll be hanged;
he would have deserved it: sixpence a day in
Pyramus, or nothing.
