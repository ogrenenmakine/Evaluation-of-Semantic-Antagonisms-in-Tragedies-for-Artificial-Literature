Noble Aufidius,
Take your commission; hie you to your bands:
Let us alone to guard Corioli:
If they set down before 's, for the remove
Bring your army; but, I think, you'll find
They've not prepared for us.
Farewell.
Get you gone.
Stand, and go back.
You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before
You'll speak with Coriolanus.
Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you
have, I am one that, telling true under him, must
say, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.
Come, my captain knows you not.
'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the
way home again.
What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?
The worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock, the
oak not to be wind-shaken.
