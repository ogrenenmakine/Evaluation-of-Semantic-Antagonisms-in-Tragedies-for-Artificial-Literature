One word, good citizens.
Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?
Consider you what services he has done for his country?
Nay, but speak not maliciously.
What he cannot help in his nature, you account a
vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.
Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved
the people.
We may, sir, if we will.
Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would
fly?
Why that way?
You are never without your tricks: you may, you may.
Your own desert!
You shall ha' it, worthy sir.
An 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter.
Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,
He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.
Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us
His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.
And will deny him:
I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.
And so did I.
So did we all. But, come, let's home.
