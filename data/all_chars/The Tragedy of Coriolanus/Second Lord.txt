Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!
The man is noble and his fame folds-in
This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us
Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,
And trouble not the peace.
Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.
His own impatience
Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.
Let's make the best of it.
