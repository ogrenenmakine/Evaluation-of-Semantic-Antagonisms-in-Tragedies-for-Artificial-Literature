No, no; no man saw 'em.
Down with him! down with him!
Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.
True,
The people are the city.
You so remain.
Yield, Marcius, yield!
Down with him, down with him!
He shall, sure on't.
No, no, no, no, no.
To the rock, to the rock with him!
It shall be so, it shall be so; let him away:
He's banish'd, and it shall be so.
It shall be so, it shall be so.
Our enemy is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!
Come, come; let's see him out at gates; come.
The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.
The gods preserve you both!
Now the gods keep you!
Faith, we hear fearful news.
