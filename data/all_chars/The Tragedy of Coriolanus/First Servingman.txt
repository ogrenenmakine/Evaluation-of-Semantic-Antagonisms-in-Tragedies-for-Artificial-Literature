Wine, wine, wine! What service
is here! I think our fellows are asleep.
What would you have, friend? whence are you?
Here's no place for you: pray, go to the door.
A strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get him
out of the house: prithee, call my master to him.
Here's a strange alteration!
What an arm he has! he turned me about with his
finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.
He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,
but I thought there was more in him than I could think.
I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.
Nay, it's no matter for that.
Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the
greater soldier.
Ay, and for an assault too.
What, what, what? let's partake.
Wherefore? wherefore?
Why do you say 'thwack our general '?
He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth
on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched
him like a carbon ado.
But, more of thy news?
Directitude! what's that?
But when goes this forward?
Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as
day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and
full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;
mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more
bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.
Ay, and it makes men hate one another.
