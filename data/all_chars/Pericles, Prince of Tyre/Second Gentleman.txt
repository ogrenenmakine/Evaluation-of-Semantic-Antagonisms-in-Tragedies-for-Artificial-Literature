Good morrow to your lordship.
That is the cause we trouble you so early;
'Tis not our husbandry.
Your honour has through Ephesus pour'd forth
Your charity, and hundreds call themselves
Your creatures, who by you have been restored:
And not your knowledge, your personal pain, but even
Your purse, still open, hath built Lord Cerimon
Such strong renown as time shall ne'er decay.
'Tis like a coffin, sir.
'Tis so, my lord.
A delicate odour.
Most likely, sir.
Is not this strange?
No, nor never shall do in such a place as this, she
being once gone.
No, no. Come, I am for no more bawdy-houses:
shall's go hear the vestals sing?
