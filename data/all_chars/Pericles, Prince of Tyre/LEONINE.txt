I will do't; but yet she is a goodly creature.
I am resolved.
I warrant you, madam.
South-west.
Was't so?
When was this?
Come, say your prayers.
If you require a little space for prayer,
I grant it: pray; but be not tedious,
For the gods are quick of ear, and I am sworn
To do my work with haste.
To satisfy my lady.
My commission
Is not to reason of the deed, but do it.
I am sworn,
And will dispatch.
These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes;
And they have seized Marina. Let her go:
There's no hope she will return. I'll swear
she's dead,
And thrown into the sea. But I'll see further:
Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her,
Not carry her aboard. If she remain,
Whom they have ravish'd must by me be slain.
