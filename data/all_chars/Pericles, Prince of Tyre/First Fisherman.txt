What, ho, Pilch!
What, Patch-breech, I say!
Look how thou stirrest now! come away, or I'll
fetch thee with a wanion.
Alas, poor souls, it grieved my heart to hear what
pitiful cries they made to us to help them, when,
well-a-day, we could scarce help ourselves.
Why, as men do a-land; the great ones eat up the
little ones: I can compare our rich misers to
nothing so fitly as to a whale; a' plays and
tumbles, driving the poor fry before him, and at
last devours them all at a mouthful: such whales
have I heard on o' the land, who never leave gaping
till they've swallowed the whole parish, church,
steeple, bells, and all.
No, friend, cannot you beg? Here's them in our
country Greece gets more with begging than we can do
with working.
Die quoth-a? Now gods forbid! I have a gown here;
come, put it on; keep thee warm. Now, afore me, a
handsome fellow! Come, thou shalt go home, and
we'll have flesh for holidays, fish for
fasting-days, and moreo'er puddings and flap-jacks,
and thou shalt be welcome.
Hark you, sir, do you know where ye are?
Why, I'll tell you: this is called Pentapolis, and
our king the good Simonides.
Ay, sir; and he deserves so to be called for his
peaceable reign and good government.
Marry, sir, half a day's journey: and I'll tell
you, he hath a fair daughter, and to-morrow is her
birth-day; and there are princes and knights come
from all parts of the world to just and tourney for her love.
O, sir, things must be as they may; and what a man
cannot get, he may lawfully deal for--his wife's soul.
What mean you, sir?
Why, wilt thou tourney for the lady?
Why, do 'e take it, and the gods give thee good on't!
