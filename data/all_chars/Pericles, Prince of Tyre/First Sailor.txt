What courage, sir? God save you!
Slack the bolins there! Thou wilt not, wilt thou?
Blow, and split thyself.
Sir, your queen must overboard: the sea works high,
the wind is loud, and will not lie till the ship be
cleared of the dead.
Pardon us, sir; with us at sea it hath been still
observed: and we are strong in custom. Therefore
briefly yield her; for she must overboard straight.
