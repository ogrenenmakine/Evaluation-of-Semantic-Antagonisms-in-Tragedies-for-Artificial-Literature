The clerk of Chatham: he can write and read and
cast accompt.
We took him setting of boys' copies.
Has a book in his pocket with red letters in't.
Sir, he made a chimney in my father's house, and
the bricks are alive at this day to testify it;
therefore deny it not.
If this fellow be wise, he'll never call ye Jack
Cade more: I think he hath a very fair warning.
