Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
I strike quickly, being moved.
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
to the wall.
'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
maids, and cut off their heads.
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
take it in what sense thou wilt.
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
Fear me not.
Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
I do bite my thumb, sir.
No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
bite my thumb, sir.
If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
Well, sir.
Yes, better, sir.
Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
