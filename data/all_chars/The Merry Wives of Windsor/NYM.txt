Slice, I say! pauca, pauca: slice! that's my humour.
Be avised, sir, and pass good humours: I will say
'marry trap' with you, if you run the nuthook's
humour on me; that is the very note of it.
He was gotten in drink: is not the humour conceited?
The good humour is to steal at a minute's rest.
The anchor is deep: will that humour pass?
The humour rises; it is good: humour me the angels.
I thank thee for that humour.
I will run no base humour: here, take the
humour-letter: I will keep the havior of reputation.
I have operations which be humours of revenge.
By welkin and her star!
With both the humours, I:
I will discuss the humour of this love to Page.
My humour shall not cool: I will incense Page to
deal with poison; I will possess him with
yellowness, for the revolt of mine is dangerous:
that is my true humour.
