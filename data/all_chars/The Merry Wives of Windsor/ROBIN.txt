Sir, here's a woman would speak with you.
I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a man
than follow him like a dwarf.
Sir John Falstaff.
My master, Sir John, is come in at your back-door,
Mistress Ford, and requests your company.
Ay, I'll be sworn. My master knows not of your
being here and hath threatened to put me into
everlasting liberty if I tell you of it; for he
swears he'll turn me away.
