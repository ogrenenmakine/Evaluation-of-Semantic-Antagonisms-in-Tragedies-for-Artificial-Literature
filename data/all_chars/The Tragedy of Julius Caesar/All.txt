None, Brutus, none.
Live, Brutus! live, live!
The will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will.
The will! the testament!
Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay!
Let not a traitor live!
We'll mutiny.
Peace, ho! Hear Antony. Most noble Antony!
Most true. The will! Let's stay and hear the will.
Peace, ho!
