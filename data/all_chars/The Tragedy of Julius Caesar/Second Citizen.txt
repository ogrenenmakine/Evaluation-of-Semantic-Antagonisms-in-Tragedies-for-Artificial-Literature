I will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons,
When severally we hear them rendered.
Give him a statue with his ancestors.
Peace, silence! Brutus speaks.
Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.
If thou consider rightly of the matter,
Caesar has had great wrong.
Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.
They were villains, murderers: the will! read the will.
Descend.
Room for Antony, most noble Antony.
O noble Caesar!
We will be revenged.
We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him.
Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.
Go fetch fire.
Whither are you going?
Answer every man directly.
That's as much as to say, they are fools that marry:
you'll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed; directly.
That matter is answered directly.
