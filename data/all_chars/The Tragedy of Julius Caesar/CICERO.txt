Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?
Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?
Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?
Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time:
But men may construe things after their fashion,
Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?
Good night then, Casca: this disturbed sky
Is not to walk in.
