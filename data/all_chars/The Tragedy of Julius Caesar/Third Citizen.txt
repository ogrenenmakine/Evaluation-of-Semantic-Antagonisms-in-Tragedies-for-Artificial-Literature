The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!
Let him be Caesar.
Let him go up into the public chair;
We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.
He says, for Brutus' sake,
He finds himself beholding to us all.
Nay, that's certain:
We are blest that Rome is rid of him.
Has he, masters?
I fear there will a worse come in his place.
There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
You shall have leave.
O woful day!
Away, then! come, seek the conspirators.
O royal Caesar!
Pluck down benches.
Where do you dwell?
Ay, and truly, you were best.
Your name, sir, truly.
Tear him, tear him! Come, brands ho! fire-brands:
to Brutus', to Cassius'; burn all: some to Decius'
house, and some to Casca's; some to Ligarius': away, go!
