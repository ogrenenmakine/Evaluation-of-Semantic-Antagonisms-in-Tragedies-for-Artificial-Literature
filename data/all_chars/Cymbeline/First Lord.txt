Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the
violence of action hath made you reek as a
sacrifice: where air comes out, air comes in:
there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.
Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass, if he be
not hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.
Stand you! You have land enough of your own: but
he added to your having; gave you some ground.
Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain
go not together: she's a good sign, but I have seen
small reflection of her wit.
I'll attend your lordship.
What got he by that? You have broke his pate with
your bowl.
Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?
There's an Italian come; and, 'tis thought, one of
Leonatus' friends.
One of your lordship's pages.
Your lordship is the most patient man in loss, the
most coldest that ever turned up ace.
But not every man patient after the noble temper of
your lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win.
Day, my lord.
Good my liege,
The day that she was missing he was here:
I dare be bound he's true and shall perform
All parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten,
There wants no diligence in seeking him,
And will, no doubt, be found.
So please your majesty,
The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,
Are landed on your coast, with a supply
Of Roman gentlemen, by the senate sent.
Good my liege,
Your preparation can affront no less
Than what you hear of: come more, for more
you're ready:
The want is but to put those powers in motion
That long to move.
