He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.
Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would
not.
My lord, I know not what the matter is; but, to my
judgment, your highness is not entertained with that
ceremonious affection as you were wont; there's a
great abatement of kindness appears as well in the
general dependants as in the duke himself also and
your daughter.
I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken;
for my duty cannot be silent when I think your
highness wronged.
Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the
fool hath much pined away.
