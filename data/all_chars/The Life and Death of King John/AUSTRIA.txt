Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,
As seal to this indenture of my love,
That to my home I will no more return,
Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France,
Together with that pale, that white-faced shore,
Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides
And coops from other lands her islanders,
Even till that England, hedged in with the main,
That water-walled bulwark, still secure
And confident from foreign purposes,
Even till that utmost corner of the west
Salute thee for her king: till then, fair boy,
Will I not think of home, but follow arms.
The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords
In such a just and charitable war.
By how much unexpected, by so much
We must awake endavour for defence;
For courage mounteth with occasion:
Let them be welcome then: we are prepared.
Peace!
What the devil art thou?
What craker is this same that deafs our ears
With this abundance of superfluous breath?
Peace! no more.
I from the north.
And your lips too; for I am well assured
That I did so when I was first assured.
Lady Constance, peace!
O, that a man should speak those words to me!
Thou darest not say so, villain, for thy life.
King Philip, listen to the cardinal.
Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs, Because--
Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
Rebellion, flat rebellion!
