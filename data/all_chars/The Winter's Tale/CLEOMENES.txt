The climate's delicate, the air most sweet,
Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing
The common praise it bears.
But of all, the burst
And the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,
Kin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense.
That I was nothing.
Great Apollo
Turn all to the best! These proclamations,
So forcing faults upon Hermione,
I little like.
All this we swear.
Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd
A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,
Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down
More penitence than done trespass: at the last,
Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;
With them forgive yourself.
Not at all, good lady:
You might have spoken a thousand things that would
Have done the time more benefit and graced
Your kindness better.
You tempt him over-much.
Good madam,--
