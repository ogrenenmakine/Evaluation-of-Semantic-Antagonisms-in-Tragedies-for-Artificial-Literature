Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never
Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them
Even to their ships.
By his great authority;
Which often hath no less prevail'd than so
On your command.
Beseech your highness, call the queen again.
For her, my lord,
I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,
Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless
I' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,
In this which you accuse her.
Good my lord,--
I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,
Upon this ground; and more it would content me
To have her honour true than your suspicion,
Be blamed for't how you might.
Well done, my lord.
You must not enter.
Beseech your highness, give us better credit:
We have always truly served you, and beseech you
So to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,
As recompense of our dear services
Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,
Which being so horrible, so bloody, must
Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.
So please you, sir, their speed
Hath been beyond account.
This your request
Is altogether just: therefore bring forth,
And in Apollos name, his oracle.
What fit is this, good lady?
The higher powers forbid!
Say no more:
Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault
I' the boldness of your speech.
