O noble emperor, do not fight by sea;
Trust not to rotten planks: do you misdoubt
This sword and these my wounds? Let the Egyptians
And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we
Have used to conquer, standing on the earth,
And fighting foot to foot.
By Hercules, I think I am i' the right.
You keep by land
The legions and the horse whole, do you not?
While he was yet in Rome,
His power went out in such distractions as
Beguiled all spies.
They say, one Taurus.
A thousand, sir,
Early though't be, have on their riveted trim,
And at the port expect you.
The gods make this a happy day to Antony!
Hadst thou done so,
The kings that have revolted, and the soldier
That has this morning left thee, would have still
Follow'd thy heels.
Who!
One ever near thee: call for Enobarbus,
He shall not hear thee; or from Caesar's camp
Say 'I am none of thine.'
Sir,
He is with Caesar.
Most certain.
Enobarbus, Antony
Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with
His bounty overplus: the messenger
Came on my guard; and at thy tent is now
Unloading of his mules.
Mock not, Enobarbus.
I tell you true: best you safed the bringer
Out of the host; I must attend mine office,
Or would have done't myself. Your emperor
Continues still a Jove.
