Brother, good night: to-morrow is the day.
Nothing. What news?
Well, sir, good night.
List, list!
Music i' the air.
Peace, I say!
What should this mean?
Walk; let's see if other watchmen
Do hear what we do?
Ay; is't not strange?
Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;
Let's see how it will give off.
If we be not relieved within this hour,
We must return to the court of guard: the night
Is shiny; and they say we shall embattle
By the second hour i' the morn.
Enobarbus!
Let's hear him, for the things he speaks
May concern Caesar.
Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as his
Was never yet for sleep.
The hand of death hath raught him.
Hark! the drums
Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him
To the court of guard; he is of note: our hour
Is fully out.
