He hath no friends but who are friends for fear.
Which in his greatest need will shrink from him.
Unless I have mista'en his colours much,
Which well I am assured I have not done,
His regiment lies half a mile at least
South from the mighty power of the king.
Upon my life, my lord, I'll under-take it;
And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!
