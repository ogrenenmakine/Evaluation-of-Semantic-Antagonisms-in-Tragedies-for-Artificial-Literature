Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?
Ay, that the king is dead.
Give you good morrow, sir.
No, no; by God's good grace his son shall reign.
So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.
Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother.
Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well.
