Do not say so.
Madam, he's gone to serve the duke of Florence:
We met him thitherward; for thence we came,
And, after some dispatch in hand at court,

Such is his noble purpose; and believe 't,
The duke will lay upon him all the honour
That good convenience claims.
We serve you, madam,
In that and all your worthiest affairs.
