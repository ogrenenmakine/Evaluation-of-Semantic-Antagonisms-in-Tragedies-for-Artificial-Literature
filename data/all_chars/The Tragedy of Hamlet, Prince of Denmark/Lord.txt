My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young
Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in
the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to
play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.
The king and queen and all are coming down.
The queen desires you to use some gentle
entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.
