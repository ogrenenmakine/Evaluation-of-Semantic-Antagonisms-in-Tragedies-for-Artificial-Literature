The king, my lord, and Harry Prince of Wales
Are near at hand: the rest the paper tells.
At Basingstoke, my lord.
No; fifteen hundred foot, five hundred horse,
Are marched up to my lord of Lancaster,
Against Northumberland and the Archbishop.
I must wait upon my good lord here; I thank you,
good Sir John.
