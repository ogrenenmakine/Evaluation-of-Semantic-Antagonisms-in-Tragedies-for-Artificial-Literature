Ay, sir, when he goes before me.
Sir, I do depend upon the lord.
The lord be praised!
Faith, sir, superficially.
I hope I shall know your honour better.
You are in the state of grace.
I do but partly know, sir: it is music in parts.
Wholly, sir.
To the hearers, sir.
At mine, sir, and theirs that love music.
Who shall I command, sir?
That's to 't indeed, sir: marry, sir, at the request
of Paris my lord, who's there in person; with him,
the mortal Venus, the heart-blood of beauty, love's
invisible soul,--
No, sir, Helen: could you not find out that by her
attributes?
Sodden business! there's a stewed phrase indeed!
I go, my lord.
