Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in.
Why, then, the champions are prepared, and stay
For nothing but his majesty's approach.
Cousin, farewell: what presence must not know,
From where you do remain let paper show.
I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,
But to the next highway, and there I left him.
Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind,
Which then blew bitterly against our faces,
Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance
Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.
'Farewell:'
And, for my heart disdained that my tongue
Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
To counterfeit oppression of such grief
That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.
Marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours
And added years to his short banishment,
He should have had a volume of farewells;
But since it would not, he had none of me.
Yea, my lord. How brooks your grace the air,
After your late tossing on the breaking seas?
He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,
Grows strong and great in substance and in power.
Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so pale?
Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.
Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?
Where is the duke my father with his power?
My father hath a power; inquire of him
And learn to make a body of a limb.
My liege, one word.
No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words
Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.
Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.
Princes and noble lords,
What answer shall I make to this base man?
Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars,
On equal terms to give him chastisement?
Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd
With the attainder of his slanderous lips.
There is my gage, the manual seal of death,
That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou liest,
And will maintain what thou hast said is false
In thy heart-blood, though being all too base
To stain the temper of my knightly sword.
Excepting one, I would he were the best
In all this presence that hath moved me so.
Thou darest not, coward, live to see that day.
Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.
An if I do not, may my hands rot off
And never brandish more revengeful steel
Over the glittering helmet of my foe!
Who sets me else? by heaven, I'll throw at all:
I have a thousand spirits in one breast,
To answer twenty thousand such as you.
Some honest Christian trust me with a gage
That Norfolk lies: here do I throw down this,
If he may be repeal'd, to try his honour.
You holy clergymen, is there no plot
To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?
Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not:
God knows I had as lief be none as one.
For aught I know, my lord, they do.
If God prevent not, I purpose so.
My lord, 'tis nothing.
I do beseech your grace to pardon me:
It is a matter of small consequence,
Which for some reasons I would not have seen.
I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it.
Good mother, be content; it is no more
Than my poor life must answer.
Where is the king?
God save your grace! I do beseech your majesty,
To have some conference with your grace alone.
For ever may my knees grow to the earth,
My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth
Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.
Then give me leave that I may turn the key,
That no man enter till my tale be done.
Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear.
Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd:
I do repent me; read not my name there
My heart is not confederate with my hand.
Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.
