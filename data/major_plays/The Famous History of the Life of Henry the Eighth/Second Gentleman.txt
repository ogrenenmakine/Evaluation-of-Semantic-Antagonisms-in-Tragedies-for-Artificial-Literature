O, God save ye!
Even to the hall, to hear what shall become
Of the great Duke of Buckingham.
Were you there?
Pray, speak what has happen'd.
Is he found guilty?
I am sorry for't.
But, pray, how pass'd it?
That was he
That fed him with his prophecies?
After all this, how did he bear himself?
I do not think he fears death.
Certainly
The cardinal is the end of this.
That trick of state
Was a deep envious one.
All the commons
Hate him perniciously, and, o' my conscience,
Wish him ten fathom deep: this duke as much
They love and dote on; call him bounteous Buckingham,
The mirror of all courtesy;--
Let's stand close, and behold him.
If the duke be guiltless,
'Tis full of woe: yet I can give you inkling
Of an ensuing evil, if it fall,
Greater than this.
This secret is so weighty, 'twill require
A strong faith to conceal it.
I am confident,
You shall, sir: did you not of late days hear
A buzzing of a separation
Between the king and Katharine?
But that slander, sir,
Is found a truth now: for it grows again
Fresher than e'er it was; and held for certain
The king will venture at it. Either the cardinal,
Or some about him near, have, out of malice
To the good queen, possess'd him with a scruple
That will undo her: to confirm this too,
Cardinal Campeius is arrived, and lately;
As all think, for this business.
I think you have hit the mark: but is't not cruel
That she should feel the smart of this? The cardinal
Will have his will, and she must fall.
So are you.
'Tis all my business. At our last encounter,
The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.
'Tis well: the citizens,
I am sure, have shown at full their royal minds--
As, let 'em have their rights, they are ever forward--
In celebration of this day with shows,
Pageants and sights of honour.
May I be bold to ask at what that contains,
That paper in your hand?
I thank you, sir: had I not known those customs,
I should have been beholding to your paper.
But, I beseech you, what's become of Katharine,
The princess dowager? how goes her business?
Alas, good lady!
The trumpets sound: stand close, the queen is coming.
A royal train, believe me. These I know:
Who's that that bears the sceptre?
A bold brave gentleman. That should be
The Duke of Suffolk?
And that my Lord of Norfolk?
Heaven bless thee!
Thou hast the sweetest face I ever look'd on.
Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel;
Our king has all the Indies in his arms,
And more and richer, when he strains that lady:
I cannot blame his conscience.
Those men are happy; and so are all are near her.
I take it, she that carries up the train
Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk.
Their coronets say so. These are stars indeed;
And sometimes falling ones.
You saw
The ceremony?
Good sir, speak it to us.
But, what follow'd?
What two reverend bishops
Were those that went on each side of the queen?
He of Winchester
Is held no great good lover of the archbishop's,
The virtuous Cranmer.
Who may that be, I pray you?
He will deserve more.
